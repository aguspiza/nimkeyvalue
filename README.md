Shameless copy of geohot's minikeyvalue https://github.com/geohot/minikeyvalue ported to nim

NOTE: minikeyvalue was programmed in python3 originally but it seems it has been rewritten in go

This implementation tries to test how fast can be programmed and how fast it is compared to python3 and go implementation
